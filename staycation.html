<h2>New York Staycation May 2016</h2>

<h3>Day 1 - Wednesday May 18th</h3>

<p>In the morning, I worked on fixing some things on a very old PHP based site I helped create almost 10 years ago. The owner of the site moved it to another hosting plan at the same provider, and neglected to copy over the database, just the files.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I took my bike on the subway up to 175th Street and then rode over the GWB, and then for about 10 miles up the river. The train was very crowded and my bike bumped into other people as the train bounced around. This was a very awkward experience, but it allowed me to go further on my bike so it was probably worth it. This road was part of the Palisades park and was very quite, almost no cars and just a few bikes. There was a man sitting on a small folding chair in the road, with a camera with a very long zoom lense looking across the river. Overall, a very nice ride. On the way back, even though my back was hurting from the long ride, I took the bike path along the west side highway to avoid the awkward experience on the subway. Total distanced pedaled was 34 miles.</p>

<h3>Day 2 - Thursday May 19th</h3>

<p>In the morning, fixed the form mailer on the site, since the new hosting plan didn't include a form mailer.  I ended up writing a new PHP page which uses the mail() function.</p>
<p>Then, I took the bus up to Wawayanda State Park in NJ and hiked to Terrace Pond. Very nice hike with waterfalls, great views of the surrounding countryside, and a beautiful secluded alpine lake. I probably hiked around 7 or 8 miles, and saw no one else on the trails. It was a weekday so that might explain the lack of other people.</p>

<h3>Day 3 - Friday May 20th</h3>

<p>Finally wrapped up work with the site. Glad to be done with it. Then I took the bike onto the Staten Island Ferry, something I had been wanting to do for a long time. Very nice ride with great views of the skyline. Rode Bay Street down to the South Beach boardwalk. Not a great ride, with lots of trucks and other heavy traffic. Got to the beach and just relaxed on the boardwalk for a while, listened to a podcast and then rode to the end of the boardwalk, and then up to the Staten Island Railroad, about half-way along the line. This part of the ride was through quiet tree-lined residential streets and was much better than the ride going to the beach. Got onto the train and was surprised that there was no obvious way to buy a ticket, then was even more surprised that the train was just a subway train with the same ads and everything. Once I got off at the ferry terminal, it was clear that unlike other subway lines, you pay when you get off the train rather than when you get on.</p>

<h3>Day 4 - Saturday May 21st</h3>

<p>Went to the Museum of Natural History. I really enjoyed the exhibits on forests, seeing the diaramas, stuffed animals, and the best part was the slice of a 1400 year old tree trunk.</p>

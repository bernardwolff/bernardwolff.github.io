    <h1>The Top of New York</h1>
    <p>I decided I wanted to hike to the top of the highest mountain in New York State, Mt. Marcy in the Adirondack region of upstate New York.  It was a long hike, over 14 miles.  I decided that I wanted to complete it in one day.  I had heard a rule of thumb that you should plan on one mile per hour, but that was for the White Mountains in New Hampshire.  Would the Adirondacks be even rougher terrain?  Would I be walking slower than a mile an hour?  I did not want to be hiking in the dark, so, I choose the summer solstice, actually the day after.  I would have roughly 15 and a half hours of daylight, barely enough if I was to maintain a speed of 1 mile an hour.  I woke up at 5am, just before the sun rose, grabbed some quick breakfast of cereal and yogurt, threw on my backpack, and headed out on the trail. I put my name in the trail register, a big book dating back several months of all the people who cared to enter their names, home city, and hiking plans.  Several other people had already logged their names in the register before me, with longer hikes planned.  "This won't be so bad," I told myself.  It was 6am and I had 14 hours and 45 minutes before the sun set and I'd be stranded on the side of a mountain in the dark.  The birds were chirping. I kept a swift pace, telling myself that they were cheering me on.  I did not see a single person for the first 4 or 5 miles.  By 10:30, I had reached the top.   An older couple with a dog was nonchalantly chatting with a man who appeared to be a park ranger.  "Welcome to the top of New York," he said.  He was wearing a name tag.  Tim Moody was his name and he was a "Summit Steward."  I later found out that Summit Stewards are hired to spend their days on the summit of some of the more popular high peaks in the Adirondacks and educate visitors on the extremely fragile "alpine zone" ecosystem.  I checked my map and noticed that there was another mountain only about 1 mile away named Mt. Skylight.  Additionally, Lake Tear of the Clouds, the source of the Hudson River, was not far from that.  I asked Tim what he thought about these points of interest and he recommended them. "If you have the time and you think you're up for it, it's a great hike," he said.  It would add about 3 miles to my return trip.  I sat down and munched on my sandwich and pondered the path ahead of me.  On the summit of Skylight, I saw a woman wearing what appeared to be some kind of head-gear worn by bee keepers.  Strange, I thought, until a swarm of flies began biting me like I was some sort of tasty snack.  I quickly descended the mountain, my knees now feeling a bit sore from the 8 or so miles I had already done.  I had about 9 more miles to go if I was to stick to my plan.  At each trail intersection, there is a helpful signpost pointing in each direction indicating points of interest.   I followed the signs to Lake Tear of the Clouds.  After a few hours, I reached the lake, more of a pond, and sat down to eat a snack.  Within seconds, the flies returned and began devouring me.  Too bad, I thought, it was a very beautiful spot.  By this point, the sweat had started to run into my eyes and to make matters worse, it had carried sunscreen with it.  Somehow this must have attracted the flies to my eyes and I could barely see.  I used my jacket as a fly swatter, and despite my aching legs, started to run down the trail.  By 5:00, I had returned to the trailhead where I began the hike, just in time for the 6:15 dinner served at the lodge where I was staying.  The total hike clocked in at about 17 miles in 11 hours, an average of about 1.5 miles per hour including all of the stops I took to take photos and to rest and eat.</p>
    <p>Later I learned that there is a club called the "46ers".  To be inducted in to the club, you must hike to the top of the 46 peaks in the Adirondacks which are higher than 4000 feet.  If I can make 22 more trips like this, I can accomplish this goal.  At the lodge, I met a retired FDNY firefighter who has a brother who recently completed the 46.  He explained that Mt Marcy is one of the easier peaks, because it is not as steep, and the trail isn't as long as some of the others.  Other peaks cannot be completed in a day and require multi-day backpacking trips, in which you must bring all of your supplies with you in your backpack and camp out in the backcountry.  That night, a woman from North Carolina gave a talk on her record-setting thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail, an approximately 2200 mile mountainous foot trail from Maine to Georgia.  Jennifer Pharr-Davis, with the help of her friends and family, had completed the trail in 46 days, averaging over 40 miles per day.  I felt an incredible sense of accomplishment for hiking to the top of the highest mountain in the state, but hearing her talk, I was really able to put my accomplishments in perspective.</p>
